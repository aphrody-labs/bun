//! `bun host`: resource inventory of a machine (CPU, RAM, GPU, disks, kernel, OS, WireGuard IPs) and
//! the shared registry that merges the cards of several machines. The JSON schema in [`schema`] is
//! the single source of truth for the CLI, the registry files and the `host_*` MCP tools.

// Runs inside a CLI subcommand and an MCP tool, outside Bun's event loop, and spawns read-only
// probes: std I/O and std::process are intended here, as in `bun_vfs` and `bun_ssh`.
