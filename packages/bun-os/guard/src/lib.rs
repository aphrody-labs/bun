//! `aphrody-guard` — safety guardrails for the autonomous `aphrody` agent.
//!
//! aphrody runs with **no human in the loop** (cf. `CLAUDE.md` §0.1) while it
//! holds live credentials under `secrets/`. Two classes of guardrail live here:
//!
//! * [`harden`] — pre-`main` process hardening: block core dumps and ptrace attach, and strip the
//!   dynamic-loader injection vectors (`LD_*` / `DYLD_*`) from the environment before any work
//!   happens.
//! * [`command_safety`] — a conservative, cross-platform classifier that maps a tokenised shell
//!   command to [`Decision::Allow`] (provably read-only), [`Decision::Prompt`] (unknown — escalate
//!   / require approval), or [`Decision::Forbidden`] (known-destructive), so an agent can
//!   auto-approve only the commands it can prove are harmless.
//!
//! Design distilled from OpenAI Codex's `process-hardening` and `shell-command`
//! crates (Apache-2.0), re-implemented here with zero external parser
//! dependencies (no `tree-sitter`, no `starlark`) to stay lean and `cargo deny`
//! clean.
