// shell.ts — thin re-export of Bun.$ for code that n2b flags as
// `api/child_process-exec`. `Bun.$` is Bun's shell template literal
// (cross-platform, no /bin/sh required) — callers can import it as a
// plain identifier via `import { sh } from "@aphrody/bun-plugin-n2b/shims"`.
//
// Rationale: in a migrating codebase, ad-hoc `import { $ } from "bun"`
// lines are as noisy as `import { exec } from "child_process"`. A stable
// alias `sh` makes the refactor mechanical and keeps the import name
// agnostic to the Bun version's surface.

import { $ } from "bun";

/** Alias for `Bun.$`. Template-literal shell: `await sh\`ls -la\``. */
